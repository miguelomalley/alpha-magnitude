# alpha-magnitude
Code for the computation of alpha magnitude, see for details.
# Installation
- Install the python implementation of GUDHI.
- Download the alpha magnitude files to your root directory.
# Computing alpha magnitude for a single point cloud
- Run amagrun.py and follow the instructions for file selection and bounds.
- Run plotter.py and select the file generated by amagrun.py
# Computing alpha magnitude dimension for a single point cloud
- Run amagrun.py and follow the instructions for file selection and bounds.
- Run amagmulriregplot.py and select the file generated by amagrun.py
# Computing alpha magnitude dimension for subsamples
- Run amaglogspaced.py and follow the instructions for file selection and bounds.
- Run amagmultiregplot.py and select the files generated in the previous step. Note you may wish to adjust the bounds for regression estimation in the code itself.
